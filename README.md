Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

Data Structures and Algorithms is a course i took at NYU Tandon School of 
Engineering. In this course we performed algorithm analysis by analyzing runtimes.
This course was taught in the Python programming languageWe also wrote implementations 
for common data structures including: Lists, Stacks, Queues, Singly Linked Lists, 
Doubly Linked Lists, Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, Hash Table Maps, and.

This repository has some of the various homeworks and labs I have completed throughout the
semester. It also has some of the data structures implementations we did in class.
