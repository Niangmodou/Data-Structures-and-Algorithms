Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

Data Structures and Algorithms is a course i took at NYU Tandon School of 
Engineering. In this course we learned about common data structures and performed 
algorithm analysis by analyzing runtimes of common data structures. This course 
was taught in the Python programming language. We also wrote implementations 
for common data structures including: Lists, Stacks, Queues, Singly Linked Lists, 
Doubly Linked Lists, Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, Hash Table Maps, and Heaps.

This repository has some of the various homeworks and labs I have completed throughout the
semester. It also has some of the data structures implementations we did in class.
